    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I am an accomplished operations management professional with extensive experience providing leadership and direction to drive the achievement of key organizational operations-related goals and objectives. After attending and graduating from the University of Colorado - Boulder, I have stayed in the Boulder area to pursue a meaningful career in this beautiful setting. I decided to move into the web development industry to seek out a new challenge and push my skills even further. I am currently a student at Galvanize in cohort g106 for Full Stack Web Development.

     In my free time, I rock climb, highline, and play/ rebuild guitars and guitar effects.

  <!-- What I Do -->
    <section class="section section-light">
      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        After building an award-winning safety program at a Boulder-based solar energy co-operative, I moved into the cannabis industry where I helped to lead an extraction facility, as well as assisting in launching a new brand that crossed into the functional foods arena. My skill set cover a wide range of areas. I have managed teams as large as 80+ people, and helped launch a start-up with only one other individual. I am well-versed in effective management, being nominated for an Emerging Leaders program and am proficient in JavaScript, HTML, CSS and more. I have repeatedly demonstrated my ability to quickly pick up new tasks or languages, give and receive feedback constructively, and work well within a team dynamic. I pride myself on excellent communication skills, both written and verbal.
